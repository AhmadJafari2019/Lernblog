**Dice Game**

I want to design a dice game which will be played in a Web browser. I declared a button to begin a new game, I define another element for gathering the dice number which i roll it and i receive a number and another number to gather the score.

For dice, i used several Image to show the number of the dice, which begin from one to six.  The Game will play between two players.
