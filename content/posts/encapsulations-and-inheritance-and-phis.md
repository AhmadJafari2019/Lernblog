**Encapsulations**:   encapsulation provides the following benefits.

**\-** Control of the way data is accessed or modified

\- More flexible and easily changed code

**\-** Ability to change one part of the code without affecting other parts

**Inheritance:**

Inheritance is the process that enables one class to acquire the properties (methods and variables) of another. With inheritance, the information is placed in a more manageable, hierarchical order
