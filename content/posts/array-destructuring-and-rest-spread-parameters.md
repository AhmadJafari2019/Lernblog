## Array Destructuring 

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. 

How to unpack the elements of an array into distinct variables:

`let arr = ['1', '2', '3'];`

`let [one, two, three] = arr;`

`console.log(one); // 1`

`console.log(two); // 2`

`console.log(three); // 3`
